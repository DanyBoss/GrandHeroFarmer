# Grand Hero Farmer

Grand Hero Farmer is a tool to farm Feathers on the mobile game 'Fire Emblem Heroes'. This works because the game recently removed all Stamina costs on a game mode called Grand Hero Battle and in doing such it allows users to keep consistently repeating these maps to get Feathers.

This tool take some precations to not be "detected" as a bot, such as randomly changing coordenates and changing time delays, it is pretty much impossible for Nintendo to detect this as a bot.

## Prerequisites

 - A Phone with the game installed.
 - Must Enable Developer options on the device (see [link](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#enable))
 
And thats pretty much it.

## Configuration
Grand Hero Farmer allows you to configure most timing events in the tool (some GHB can be done faster than others, etc) and even coordenates. 

To configure you'll have to edit the `Default.xml` file in the `Configurations` folder. Currently only one .xml is supported but support for multiple ones according to launch options are in the works. 

The coordenates can be left alone for farming GHB but if you want to change the tool to farm something else then you can edit the coordenates and you'll have a completely different bot.

## How To Run

  1. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/DanyBoss/GrandHeroFarmer/releases) and extract it somewhere.
  2. On the phone open the game and get your team and select what GHB you wanna farm on, keep the screen on the `Difficulty Selection screen`.
  3. Connect the phone with the pc with a USB cable and pay attention on your phone cause he will ask you to trust the pc you're connecting on.
  4. Open the `GrandHeroFarmer.exe` and on your phone trust the PC.
  5. Follow the onscreen instructions and you're set.
  6. ...
  7. Get more +10s.

## Disclaimer

While it is highly improbable Nintendo can implement some future version of the Game to detect 'ADB' clicks and in doing such can detect the tool. Don't blame me or anyone if they do that (just fyi I do run this tool to farm on my own personal account).
